Build Tools:
Software tools used to create a application that runs on a platform(android,web,pc,console)
These are the software tools that are used to achieve better productivity and efficiency.They help in automating the process.
the processe consists of 
* compiling source code to binary code
* packaging the binary code for the required platform
* managing the libraries and dependencies needed to run the application
* running automated tests
* deploying the application on platform
* monitoring the use of application

all these steps can be performed manually but since these tasks are same for many applications we can create a script and automate the process.

Ex:Ant,Maven,Gradle,Grunt,Gulp
Ant: used in cli and is the most basic build tool
maven:the most widely used tested and stable build tool.It uses xml for performing tasks
gradel:mix of ant and maven , is still new and rising in popularity. uses groovy/kotlin languages for scripting
grunt/gulp: these are web development build tools
